# Tic Tac Toe w/ AI: Archived from June 2021

## Retrospective review notes taken from [my personal website](https://ahmeralam.co.uk/) (2024)
*My first experience making 2D games with the Pygame module. In this project, I built a simple yet engaging Tic Tac Toe game featuring a clean and intuitive interface, smooth controls, and an intelligent A.I opponent. The game offers an enjoyable and challenging experience for users, marking a solid introduction to both game development and artificial intelligence for myself.*

*Technically, the project involved implementing game logic, detecting win conditions, and managing player input. The A.I opponent was implemented using the minimax algorithm, allowing it to play optimally. With that being said, this project served as a warmup for the more complex 'Chess A.I Game' I would later undertake...*
